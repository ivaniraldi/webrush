## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, near-black with a dark gray to violet gradient overlay (#12121A).
- Primary color: Violet (#8A5CF3) to represent innovation and energy.
- Accent color: A brighter, lighter violet analogous to the primary, providing contrast for CTAs and highlights (#B48CF8).
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, should be used for headlines and short amounts of body text for a contemporary and fashionable feel. 'Montserrat' can be used for other text elements.
- Use a clean and modern layout with clear sections for each plan, making it easy for users to compare and choose the best option for their needs.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as hover effects on plan selections or smooth scrolling.
- Employ simple, clear icons to represent plan features and benefits, reinforcing understanding at a glance. Use lucide-react for icons
